This repository provides all source code for simulations and experiments for the paper "[Shrewd Selection Speeds Surfing: Use Smart EXP3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03038)".

You will find source code to perform the following:
* Simulation in static and dynamic settings.
* Trace-driven simulation.
* Controlled experiment.
* In-the-wild experiment.
* Measure delay observed when switching between networks and identify the probability distribution that best fits the delay values.

## Note: The code is not optimized and this repository will not be maintained.
