# SmartEXP3
This project provides all source code for simulations and experiments for the paper "[Shrewd Selection Speeds Surfing: Use Smart EXP3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03038)".

The wireless network selection problem is formulated as a congestion game and the behavior of devices modeled using online learning in the adversarial bandit setting. Smart EXP3 is a wireless network selection algorithm that has good theoretical and practical performance. Empirical results show that it gracefully deals with transient behaviors, has relatively fast convergence to the optimal network with reduced switching, and achieves fairness among devices. It has the same convergence and regret properties as EXP3, a standard bandit algorithm.

You will find the source code for the following:
* Simulations in static and dynamic settings.
* Trace-driven simulation.
* Controlled experiments.
* In-the-wild experiments.
* Measure delay observed when switching between networks and identify the probability distribution that best fits the delay values.

# Note: The code is not optimized and this project will not be maintained.
