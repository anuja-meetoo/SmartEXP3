Simulates wireless network selection in a setting where devices are time-synchronized and are in the service area throughout the experiment. Devices have access to different sets of wireless networks, depending on their location. Some devices move and discover new sets of wireless networks. All devices leverage the same selection approach.

A brief description of the files is as follows:
* wns_mobility.py: Simulates the wireless network selection process using different algorithms; some parameters for the algorithms are set in this file.
