Simulates wireless network selection in a setting where time-synchronized devices are in the service area throughout the experiment and have access to the same set of wireless networks. All devices leverage the same selection approach.

A brief description of the files is as follows:
* wns.py: Simulates the wireless network selection process using different algorithms; some parameters for the algorithms are set in this file.
