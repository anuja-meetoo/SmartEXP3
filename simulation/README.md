Simulates the wireless network selection performed by time-synchroized devices in three settings, namely: (1) a static setting where all devices start the algorithm at the same time and have access to the same set of networks; (2) a dynamic setting where some devices enter the service area later and leave earlier than the others; (3) a dynamic setting setting where some devices leave the service area earlier than others; (4) a dynamic setting where devices move across service areas discovering new sets of wireless networks. It is assumed that all clients observe an equal share of a network's bandwidth. The cost of switching networks is measured in terms of delay and is modeled using Johnson's SU distribution for WiFi and Student's t-distribution for cellular, each identified as a best fit to 500 delay values.
