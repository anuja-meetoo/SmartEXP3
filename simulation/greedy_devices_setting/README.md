Simulates wireless network selection in a static setting where time-synchronized devices are in the service area throughout the experiment and have access to the same set of wireless networks. Some devices use Smart EXP3 while others leverage a greedy policy.

Before running the simulation, choose the scenario to run in the file wns_greedyDevices.py (lines 1400 - 1416; comment out the other scenarios).
